# MLH Hack Week Projects

Welcome to my personal repository for MLH Hack Week projects! Here, I'll be creating and submitting projects for the MLH Hack Week challenges. Each project will be contained in its own folder, along with a README file describing the project and how it meets the challenge requirements.

## Current Projects
